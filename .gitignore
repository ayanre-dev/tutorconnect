# (Optional: Keep package-lock.json if you want consistent installs, but some users prefer ignoring it. 
# Standard practice is usually to KEEP it, but if "simply npm install" implies avoiding lockfile constraints, 
# sometimes ppl ignore it. However, for a robust project, KEEPING it is better. 
# The user asked for "simply npm install", usually that implies `package-lock.json` SHOULD be committed 
# so others get the EXACT same versions. I will NOT ignore package-lock.json based on standard best practices, 
# unless the user typically wants to regenerate it. 
# Re-reading prompt: "push and someone clones they can simply npm install". 
# The best way to ensure this works is to COMMIT package-lock.json. 
# So I will NOT add package-lock.json to .gitignore.)
